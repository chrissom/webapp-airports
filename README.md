# Webapp Airports

This is the Lunatech homework. Data used: [airports](http://ourairports.com/data/).

## [ ] Milestone 1: make it

Ship as fast as possible a working version. Obviously poor in performance due to CSV sizes...

## [ ] Milestone 2: make it fast

Improve performance:

- clean csv files (remove quotes, add default value...): scripted task for future updates
- use Spark (DataFrames, Datasets, SQL, Streaming): load data when Play start

## [ ] Milestone 3: make it cool

Improve UX:

- use React for frontend: good library to display huge data
- expose a API for backend: keep value on server side
- use JSON for data transport: natural binding in Javascript

## [ ] Milestone 4: make it fun

Improve developer UX:

- expose a graphql endpoint
- remove Play for something more light and fast

# Note

No tests because lack of time but I would used ScalaTest.
